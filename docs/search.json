I have a broad interest in using data for social justice topics as well as analyzing trends in international relations and the global economy.\nAbout the Project\nAn Overview of Occupancy in Toronto Shelters: Housing has always been a hot topic in the City of Toronto, with low-income housing areas in Regent’s Park being viewed as dangerous and unsafe, with chronic problems in housing especially during Canada’s colder winter months. Most recently, Toronto police are in standoffs with the public regarding their evictions of a homeless encampment in Trinity Bellwoods Park. This led me to ask: how used are Toronto shelters? How much demand is there currently for the shelters, and are they keeping up with this demand? Check out this page for broad trends, or this page here for shelter data from individual postal codes.\nGoals of This Project\nMap the changes in occupancy of Toronto shelters throughout the year.\nAnalyze how COVID-19 may have affected the occupancy levels of shelters.\nIt’s going to be hard to tell whether the lower levels of occupancy in the summer are due to COVID or whether they’re due to the warmer temperatures and not needing to use shelters to stay out of the cold.\n\nSee whether certain postal codes have chronic problems with either filling their shelters or too many people.\nCredits\nThis project was created thanks to Kane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp. Check out the link here to learn more about the summer program!\n\n\n\n",

Trends\nIt’s clear that winter months tend to have the highest occupancy ratios, with the average occupancy rate on January 24th, 2020 being 97%. This could most likely be attributed to the lower temperatures, with the average temperature in January and February being around -5°C (23°F), but with the lows dipping down to -16°C (3.2°F). However, it is also clear that COVID-19 had a significant impact on occupancy rates, as shelters, even during December 2020, did not regain their occupancy rates and stayed at around 77%, possibly due to requirements put in by the City to limit the spread of the disease.
